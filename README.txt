This is the repository for the MEG421 final year project.

We are making an ESC - Electronic Speed controller using a PIC32. 

A requirement is to have a sensor. The most 'basic' idea would be to simply use the potentiometer built into the PIC as a sensor, taking its value as the input for which to control the speed.

We need to develop the full circuit for the project.
